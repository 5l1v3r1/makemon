# makemon by Yokai Seishinkage #
Make a single (or up to 10) monitor mode wireless interfaces with unique mac addresses.

# Dependencies
1.) iw
2.) macchanger
3.) systemd
4.) pamd
5.) ifconfig

# Installation
Move "makemon" to "/usr/bin/" directory/folder or any directory you choose and make an
alias to it in your .bashrc file and make the file executable. That's it.

[Steps to install]
Open linux terminal and enter each step in order.
1.) git clone https://github.com/Yo-kai-Sei-shin-kage/makemon.git
2.) cd makemon/
3.) mv makemon /usr/bin
4.) chown root:root /usr/bin/makemon
5.) chmod +x /usr/bin/makemon

# Usage
Enter "makemon" as a terminal command. Then follow the prompts.
 
# Extra Info
This tool does not use "macchanger" to generate mac addresses. It, instead, uses macchanger
to compare the randomly generated mac with macchanger's mac vendor list to make sure the mac is
valid. It isn't necessary or required to set the global IFACE variable when first prompted but,
you will be asked to do so each time makemon is run.
 
# Disclaimer
This tool is released to the public in the hopes that it will be useful. This has not been coded
in the most perfect and absolutely best manner. This is done intentionally to spur users into
looking into bash programming on their own and figure out ways to help improve open source tools
and the open source community. Cheers!!
